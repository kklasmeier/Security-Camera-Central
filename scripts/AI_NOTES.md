this is a description of an image taken from a security camera. Motion was detected causing this picture to be taken. describe for me in a short phrase what this motion was based on this description given. The phrase is used for efficiency of alerts in logs of security footage. Give the phrase only, nothing else.

“In one of the images, there is a woman standing outside with her arms raised above her head. She appears to be playing with a white object or throwing it into the air. The other image shows a man standing next to an outdoor grill on a patio area. Both individuals are in different positions and facing opposite directions.”
